      <h2 id="what-is-global-warming">What is global warming?</h2>
      <p>
        The continual rise in the average global temperature and its
        consequences for the climate system on Earth are known as global
        warming. The rate of increase in the average world temperature is
        currently faster than in the past.

        What is causing global warming?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Human activity is the main cause of global warming. Carbon dioxide
        and
        methane are two of the main greenhouse gases that are increased by
        the
        use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and some industrial and
        agricultural
        practises.

        Why do greenhouse gases increase global warming?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Some of the heat that the Earth radiates after being warmed by
        sunlight
        is absorbed by greenhouse gases. More of these gases trap more heat
        in
        the lower atmosphere of the Earth, contributing to global
        warming.When
        greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere, they act as
        insulation, keeping the heat from the sun from going back out into
        space. This means that there is more heat in the lower atmosphere of
        Earth, contributing to climate change. This means that the more
        CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O we release, the
        warmer
        and warmer the Earth will become.

      <h2 id="impacts">Impacts</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to heat waves and wildfires being more frequent, deserts
        are
        growing larger. Permafrost melting, glacier retreat, and a reduction
        in
        sea ice have all been impacted by increased heat in the Arctic.
        Storms,
        droughts, and other weather extremes are becoming more intense as a
        result of rising temperatures. Numerous species are being forced to
        move
        or go extinct due to the rapid environmental change occurring in the
        Arctic, coral reefs, and mountains. <br /><br />
        The most affected areas are those near deserts, and on coastlines
        that
        will be flooded if we don't do anything about it.

            <li>
              We need to stop using fossil fuels—not only are they limited,
              they
              are also very damaging for the environment.

          Invest in renewables.

              We can&#39;t stop using fossil fuels if we have nothing to

          <ul>
            <li>
              Cars are bad for the environment. We should all switch (if we
              can)
              to using a bus/a bike/our feet to get around.

              Heating costs are much higher than they have to be. If we

            <li>
              Trees are one of the main carbon sinks. They take in CO
              <sub>2</sub> and release O <sub>2</sub>. If we can replant the
              forests we lost due to deforestation, we can reduce the amount
              of
              CO <sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere.

            <li>
              The ocean absorbs lots of CO <sub>2</sub>, it&#39;s important

      <h2 id="climate-change-denial">Climate Change Denial</h2>
      <p>
        One other opinion held by some is climate change denial. Climate
        change
        is a refutation of research about climate change, its effects on
        nature,
        and humans. This can also happen when people accept the science but
        fail
        to understand it. These beliefs are very harmful considering how
        urgent
        and important action on climate change is. Climate change denial is
        often the product of oil & gas companies creating fake organisations
        and
        studies in order to muddy the waters of scientific consensus on
        climate
        change.

      <h2>Economy</h2>
      <p>
        A lot of investment will be needed to solve the climate crisis, but
        this
        doesn't mean that going green has to ruin the economy.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Shifting to a green economy could yield a direct economic gain of
        $26
        trillion through 2030 compared with business-as-usual. This could
        produce over 65 million new low-carbon jobs. -UN
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        By the year 2030, we need to invest ~$90tn on infrastructure. This
        is a
        lot, but, for every $1 we invest in good infrastructure, we can get
        $4
        back. Also, we can save up to $17tn if we build our cities in a
        smart
        and efficient way.
      </p>
      <h2 id="my-opinion-on-global-warming">My opinion on global warming</h2>
      <p>
        I think global warming is very significant, and we should be
        focusing on
        it much more. One idea could be to stop all government grants for
        oil,
        gas, and coal—and put it towards researching clean energy.
