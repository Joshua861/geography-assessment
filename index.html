      <h2 id="what-is-global-warming">What is global warming</h2>
      <p>The continual rise in the average global temperature and its consequences for the climate system on Earth are known as global warming. The rate of increase in the average world temperature is currently faster than in the past.</p>

      <p>Human activity is the main cause of global warming. Carbon dioxide and methane are two of the main greenhouse gases that are increased by the use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and some industrial and agricultural practises.</p>

      <h3 id="why-do-greenhouse-gases-increase-global-warming">Why do greenhouse gases increase global warming</h3>
      <p>Some of the heat that the Earth radiates after being warmed by sunlight is absorbed by greenhouse gases. More of these gases trap more heat in the lower atmosphere of the Earth, contributing to global warming.</p>

      <h2 id="impacts">Impacts</h2>
      <p>In addition to heat waves and wildfires being more frequent, deserts are growing larger. Permafrost melting, glacier retreat, and a reduction in sea ice have all been impacted by increased heat in the Arctic. Storms, droughts, and other weather extremes are becoming more intense as a result of rising temperatures. Numerous species are being forced to move or go extinct due to the rapid environmental change occurring in the Arctic, coral reefs, and mountains.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Keep fossil fuels in the ground. <ul>
            <li>We need to stop using fossil fuels—not only are they limited, they are also very damaging for the environment.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Invest in renewables. <ul>
            <li>We can&#39;t stop using fossil fuels if we have nothing to replace it with, we need to invest in fossil fuels now!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Switch to sustainable transport. <ul>
            <li>Cars are bad for the environment. We should all switch (if we can) to using a bus/a bike/our feet to get around.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Insulate homes. <ul>
            <li>Heating costs are much higher than they have to be. If we insulate more homes, we can save energy and the environment.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Replant forests. <ul>
            <li>Trees are one of the main carbon sinks. They take in CO <sub>2</sub> and release O <sub>2</sub>. If we can replant the forests we lost due to deforestation, we can reduce the amount of CO <sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Protect the oceans. <ul>
            <li>The ocean absorbs lots of CO <sub>2</sub>, it&#39;s important to protect it from over-fishing and drilling. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Reduce consumption. <ul>
            <li>Reducing consumption of products in wealthy countries can help put less strain on the planet.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Reduce plastic. <ul>
            <li>Plastic production is a carbon-intensive process that contributes to emissions and is expected to account for 17% of the global carbon budget by 2050.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

      <h2 id="climate-change-denial">Climate Change Denial</h2>
      <p>Climate change denial is the refutation of the scientific consensus on climate change, including its effects on nature and human society. It can also occur when people or social groups accept the science but struggle to understand it or put their acceptance into practise. These beliefs have been evaluated as denialism, pseudoscience, or propaganda.</p>

      <h2 id="my-opinion-on-global-warming">My opinion on global warming</h2>
      <p>I think global warming is very significant, and we should be focusing on it much more. One idea could be to stop all government grants for oil, gas, and coal—and put it towards researching clean energy.</p>
